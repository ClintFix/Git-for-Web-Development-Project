Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

        it is positioned relative to its ancestor element if it has one. Otherwise, it is positioned relative to the body.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        wrap in <div> and give a width
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display Block by default:
            nav

            header
        Display Inline by default:

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is how spacing works around html elements. Content -> padding -> border -> margin. Box size = width + padding + border.

        The "fix" is to use box-sizing: border-box which makes width = content width + padding + border. 

        html {
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        *, *:before, *:after {
             box-sizing: inherit;
        }
